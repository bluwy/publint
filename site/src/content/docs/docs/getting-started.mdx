`publint` is a [linter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>) that checks [npm](https://npmjs.com) packages for compatibility issues across environments, such as [Vite](https://vite.dev), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), etc. It also reports best practices and common configuration mistakes that aims to improve the overall quality of the package.

## Installation

You can use `publint` online at [publint.dev](https://publint.dev) (this website!) or install it locally, if you prefer to run it in CI or before publishing your package.

<Tabs syncKey="pm">
<TabItem label="npm">

```bash
npm install --save-dev publint
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add --save-dev publint
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add --dev publint
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, setup a script to execute `publint` in your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "publint": "publint"
  }
}
```

And run the `publint` script with your package manager:

<Tabs syncKey="pm">
<TabItem label="npm">

```bash
npm run publint
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm publint
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```bash
yarn publint
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also run a one-off check in your project like so:

<Tabs syncKey="pm">
<TabItem label="npm">

```bash
npx publint
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm dlx publint
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```bash
yarn dlx publint
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you'd like to lint a package in a different directory, you can pass the path as an argument, like `publint ./dir`. See the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli) for more information.

If you'd like to use `publint` programmatically, check out the [JavaScript API documentation](/docs/javascript-api).

:::note
If the package has a build step, it must be run first before running `publint` so that it can lint against the files to be published.

## IDE integrations

`publint` can also be used in your IDE that lints as you write code.
